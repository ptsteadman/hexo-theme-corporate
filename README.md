## Install

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ptsteadman/hexo-theme-corporate.git themes/corporate
```

## Enable

1. **Add example pages.** 

	Copy all of the contents of `themes/corporate/_source` to `source`.
	This includes a sample landing page and contact, project, and
	about pages.

	```bash
	cp -r themes/corporate/_source/* source
	```

2. **Enable theme.** 
	Modify the root site `_config.yml` so that `theme` is set to `corporate`. 

	```yml
	# Extensions
	## Plugins: http://hexo.io/plugins/
	## Themes: http://hexo.io/themes/
	theme: corporate # change this

	```

	Finally, run `npm install` and then `hexo server` to test out the site.

3. **Optional: Enable custom landing page.**

	To use custom landing page instead of the default archive index, remove
	the line containing hexo-generator-index from package.json in the project root.
	Then, edit `source/index.ejs`.

## Features

### Custom Pages

Contact, Projects, and About pages are included in the theme's `_source` directory.
When copied to the blog's `source` directory, they can be edited with your custom content.
Edit the header menu in the themes `_config.yml` to create links to these pages.

You can use [metronic CSS components](http://keenthemes.com/metronic-theme/) to build these pages.

``` yml
# Header Menu
menu:
  Home: /
  Projects: /projects/
  Blog: /archives/ # can set archive-dir in root config to custom value
  Contact: /contact/
  About: /about/
```

### Swiftype

You enable **Swiftype** search funcationality by editing the theme's `_config.yml`.

``` yml
swiftype_install_key: XXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

This `install key` can be found at your own engine's install page:

Finally, don't forget to save your swiftype configuration to complete the installation.

### Thumbnail

Set `thumbnail` in post frontmatter to display an image on the blog/archive page:

	thumbnail: https://s3.amazonaws.com/ptsteadman-images/nginx-proxy.png

### Lede

Set `lede` in post frontmatter to display a custom bit of text distinct from an excerpt:

	lede: "This text will appear by the thumbnail in the blog page."

### Author

Set `author` in post frontmatter to display an author's name.  Set `default_author` in the
site's `_config.yml` to determine author if the frontmatter value is not set.
